## External API

`reporting-hub-bop-settlements-ui` is reliant on three mojaloop services.
When running locally, you can use the environment variables
`CENTRAL_SETTLEMENTS_ENDPOINT`, `CENTRAL_LEDGER_ENDPOINT` and `REPORTING_API_ENDPOINT`
in `.env` to specify the location of the api services.

If these services are hosted on a different domain and have CORS protection,
then you can edit `devServer.proxy` `target` to point to these services instead.

NOTE: These endpoints are a stopgap. In the future these environment variables
      will be replaced for a variable that points to an operational API specifcally
      for the Settlements microfrontend instead of calling Mojaloop services directly.

## Port forwarding
If you want connect to the live services deployed in K8S, you can port forward the services using the following commands.
```
kubectl port-forward -n mojaloop service/moja-centralledger-service 3001:80 &
kubectl port-forward -n mojaloop service/moja-centralsettlement-service 3007:80 &
kubectl port-forward -n mojaloop service/bof-reporting-hub-bop-api-svc 3080:80 &
```

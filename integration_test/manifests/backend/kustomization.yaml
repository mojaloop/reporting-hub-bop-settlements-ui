  # Testcafe doesn't handle secure cookies well. For our integration tests, we make the cookie
  # insecure. This is because:
  # 1. we expect to remove auth functionality from the portal backend in the near future and hand
  #    it off to a third-party tool
  # 2. with (1) in mind, this meant we didn't need to spend time investigating the precise clause
  #    in the cookie that causes the problem
  # 3. it's not important for our tests to be secure
  #
  # Of course, the trade-off is that our tests are slightly less representative of a real
  # deployment, but we accept that because of (1).
